<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this activity, we practiced defining objects and their properties. After mastering a basic circle, we were given an image of a diamond-esque shape made out of different colored circles overlayed on each other. It took some trial and error (and loads of patience!), but I was able to recreate the image.
